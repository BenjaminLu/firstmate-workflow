# claude adapter. Hands the prompt to claude and maps its outcome onto the
# contract in _contract.md. It must never touch git or gh: the scripts above
# do all of that, which is what lets a CLI with no repository access still be
# a worker.
#
# The invocation is the non-interactive one on purpose. An adapter that opens
# a REPL hangs a dispatch until something kills it, and looks like a model
# thinking rather than a script waiting for a human who is not there.
