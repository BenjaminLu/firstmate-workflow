# firstmate-workflow

One agent runs the crew. Three things make it up:

- **`skills/`** — the content. Every role's behaviour is plain Markdown, so
  changing a skill changes behaviour without touching code.
- **`bin/fm-*.sh`** — execution and checks. They inspect repository state and
  command results; review checks also scan model-produced verdict markers.
  Firstmate must account for the enforcement gaps documented in the contract.
- **`board/`** — the captain's only console. Live state, open decisions, orders.

The agent CLI is a replaceable engine, not the system.

Spec: [`design/design.md`](design/design.md). Task DAG: [`design/tasks.json`](design/tasks.json).

## Starting a session

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) routes top-level sessions directly to the canonical
[firstmate startup contract](skills/firstmate/SKILL.md). Codex reads AGENTS.md;
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) imports the same entrypoint. Explicitly dispatched workers
and reviewers retain their supplied roles, including isolated review processes.

Firstmate inspects existing work and live agents, starts or reuses and opens the
captain board, then coordinates repository scripts and remediation. Read the
contract for visible Herdr processes, retained authorization, current-head
verification and shipped script limitations. Runtime automation does not yet
ensure all these invariants; instruction checks validate metadata and links,
not model behavior. Neither lavish nor no-mistakes is a prerequisite; their hooks
are not part of startup or verification. Scope decisions and merge approval
still belong to the captain on the board. `fm-decide.sh --request` creates a
card and returns; `--await` waits for the response. Firstmate must verify current
readiness and board approval: `fm-merge.sh` itself checks neither decision
approval nor the seven gates, and the board merge route does not rerun them.

## Rules that bind everyone

1. **Nobody writes to `main`.** Not firstmate, not a worker, not a reviewer.
   Branch, then open a pull request. `bin/fm-guard.sh` and installed hooks provide
   local checks; GitHub branch protection must be configured and verified.
   Their presence in the repository does not prove they are active.
2. **English in the repository.** README, design docs, skills, code, comments,
   commit messages, pull request bodies and reviews. The board's three
   languages are a product feature and are the one exception.
3. **Merging is the captain's.** It arrives as a decision card on the board,
   never as a sentence in a conversation.

## Getting set up

```sh
bin/fm-install-hooks.sh   # git hooks are not cloned; opt in once per checkout
bin/ci.sh                 # the one gate - CI runs this same file
```

## State

Spec is settled and the bootstrap is under way. `design/proposals/` holds the
board proposal the captain green-lit — a throwaway prototype, not the
implementation.

```sh
open design/proposals/2026-09-20-captain-board/prototype.html
```
